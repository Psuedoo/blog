Integrated into your everyday apps, your phone,\nand advertisements selling AI services constantly being shoved in your face.\nThe presence and promises of AI offer a lot of value add, but surely a\ndownfall exists...\n\nStatistically, you have used AI [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/06/03/mind-blowing-ai-statistics-everyone-must-know-about-now-in-2025/).\nWe both know that AI can make many tasks easier. Tasks being easier is perfect\nfor work output and productivity, but is really harmful to learning and skill building.\n\nI have even noticed having less of a true understanding during my studies after\nimproper use of AI.\n\n## How Learning Really Works\n\nWhat does \"learn\" even mean? [Merriam Webster defines learn](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/learn) as:\n\n> to gain knowledge or understanding of or skill in by study, instruction, or experience\n\nNotice that even the definition associates learning with study and experience.\nTruly learning something requires an understanding. You cannot have learned something\nthat you do not understand.\n\nIteration is the best method to reach an understanding. Iterating over\nand over again is a loop that looks like this:\n\n\u003Cdiv>\n  \u003Cpre class=\"mermaid\">\n---\nconfig:\n  theme: dark\n  look: classic\n---\nflowchart TB\n    A[\"Make an Attempt\"] --> B{\"Fail?\"}\n    B -- Yes --> C[\"Understand the Failure; This is where you learn\"]\n    C -- Try again with new insight --> A\n    B -- No --> D[\"Viable Solution\"]\n  \u003C/pre>\n  \u003Cscript type=\"module\">\n    import mermaid from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs\";\n  \u003C/script>\n\u003C/div>\n\nIn the flowchart, you can see that learning occurs by understanding your failure.\nFailure and frustration shows us a very clear picture of what went wrong (if you\ndig deeper to understand). Thus building a stronger foundation for the skill.\n\n- TODO: Add more information here about why failure and frustration reinforce skills\n\n## How AI Can Hurt Your Learning\n\n- TODO: Maybe a little intro here\n\n### Skipping the Struggling: Why Easy Answers Don't Stick\n\nAs I previously mentioned, struggling/failing is the part of the process that\nyou learn the most from. While you will still certainly struggle with AI,\nthe failures are different.\n\nAI removes the need for you to understand everything with your attempt.\nWhen you have the failure, you can simply get the AI to try again without\nyou ever having to think through _why_ the failure happened.\n\nThese sort of solutions often leave a very shallow mental footprint. This shallow\nfootprint makes it less ideal for building applicable skills. \"Easy come, easy go\".\n\n### Less Reinforcement, Less Retention\n\nGoing through the iterations of trial and error builds a strong muscle\nmemory. Not to get all \"inception-y\" but learning can get.\n\n- Trial and error builds \"muscle memory\" for thinking\n- AI reduces how many cycles you go through\n- Fewer cycles = less reinforcement = weaker long-term recall\n\n### The False Sense of Mastery\n\nWhile skill building, going quickly from problem to solution from AI's help\nfeels like progress but doesn't ensure you are building a good understanding.\n\nWould you know how to bake a cake from someone baking it for you? In this\nscenario, you would completely know the solution but it does not help you\n\nSometimes understanding a solution can help you understand the process to get\nthere\n\n- You may know the solution but not the \"why\"\n- Confidence vs competence\n- Dunning Kruger\n\n## How to Use AI for Learning Without Skill Atrophy\n\n- Rough notes for this section:\n  - In gymnastics, many coaches implement something called \"spotting\". Spotting is\n    a process where the coach will guide the individual through doing the flips or\n    routine. This process helps with safety, correcting faults, and building muscle\n    memory for the athlete without having to fully grasp the concept alone.\n\n### Rephrase Complex Concepts for Clarity\n\n- Use AI to explaing a tough topic in multiple ways\n- Comare its explanation with your notes to check alignment\n- Don't stop at the AI output. Treat it as one extra perspective\n- Insert good prompt to do this\n\n### Ask for Hints Instead of Full Answers\n\n- Frame prompts like: \"Point me in the right direction\"\n- Keep ownership of solving, just use AI as a nudge\n- Insert good prompt to do this\n\n### Use AI to Quiz and Test Yourself\n\n- Ask it to geenrate practice questions or flashcards\n  - Test your recall without looking back at notes\n- Turn AI into a \"sparring partner\" instead of a crutch\n\n## When It's Better to Use AI for Productivity\n\n- When the goal is an output, not skill-building\n- Useful for repetitive or low-value tasks where learning isn't the priority\n\n## Conclusion: Finding the Right Balance\n\n- AI is a tool, not a replacement for the learning process\n- Use it when the goal is speed and output, not when you need to master something\n- Struggle and failure aren't inefficiencies, they're how we build lasting skills\n- Treat AI like a guide, not a crutch\n- Balance = knowing when to lean on it and when to step back\n\n---\n\n## Join the Conversation\n\nHow do you learn etc? # TODO: Update this\n\nHave you considered making the switch?
