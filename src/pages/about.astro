    <h1>Psuedo - The Pragmatic Engineer</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I'm Psuedo.</h2>

    <!-- Another easter egg lol -->
    <!-- <p>Not sure how or why you've ended up on my blog, <em>and</em> why you've clicked to learn more about me, but I suppose I'll give you what you're looking for.</p> -->

    <p>
      As the title of this page suggests, I am historically a pragmatic
      engineer. I typically approach problems at how to solve them rather than
      theorizing about the <em>what ifs</em>. This isn't to say I don't think
      through and plan solutions.. I just strive to pick the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor"
        >simplest solution</a
      >. I also believe in <a href="https://personalmba.com/galls-law/"
        >Gall's Law</a
      >. (tldr: all complex systems are derived from once working simple
      solutions.)
    </p>

    <p>
      I was going to put some of my skills and hobbies but those lists are
      always changing. If you're interested in learning more of those things,
      message me and let's chat. Discord is probably my most used form of
      communication. Otherwise, you can probably insinuate what I enjoy/what I'm
      doing from my blog posts.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quick disclaimer is that I'm viewing this blog as something I can write
      once and share many times. I'm wanting to build out helpful resources for
      the people I mentor (and for those of you who may stumble across this).
      Because of that, sometimes I may learn something new or have updates, thus
      you might find some of my blogs will have updates. That also depends on
      how lazy I am. Since this blog is going to be open to the public, the
      <a href="https://github.com/psuedoo/blog">GitHub repo</a> will be too. Feel
      free to make pull requests to contribute things you wish were different!
