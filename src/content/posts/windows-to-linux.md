## Why Did I Switch?

After a long day of work I would find myself playing video games to relax.
While there's nothing wrong with playing video games,
I would frequently look back and miss the curiosity I had.

I used to be able to talk so in-depth about a new project, or
something newly exciting I've learned. I could, but it was always about
work projects. Rarely had it become anything I was doing outside of work.

Finally, I decided that it was time to make it easier to do tech shenanigans
than play my lil video games. Thus I installed Linux.

## My Process

This whole process was really terrifying. I have spent forever on Windows.
Yes I have spun up Linux VMs and I have Linux running on servers..
but I haven't had to do without Microsoft's opinion on everything.

I was eager to come up with a plan to make this switch easier.
However, with planning being the arch-enemy of doing, I had to be willing to make
some sacrifices.

I came up with an actionable plan.

### Step 1. Back up my data

This was rather simple. I just made sure that all of the files I cared about
like images, documents, etc. were on cloud services or moved to an external
hard drive.

### Step 2. Pick a <mark>stable</mark> distro

[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) was running on my laptop for ~6 months.
The distro was clean, nicely configured out of the box,
and seemed to be a "trendy" distro. During the period when I was frequently
using my laptop, Endeavour gave an awesome experience.

A few months then went by without using my laptop. Booted it up.
Updated everything, rebooted, then boom... it wouldn't boot.

This was my hard-learned lesson about
[rolling releases vs stable releases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=212yJEH8-iA).
Instability was certainly _not_ something I was willing to fight with.

Ubuntu has always been a tried and true distro for me. But lately I have been
feeling like it's a little bloated.

With all of the above in mind, I chose to go with [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com).
At the time of posting this blog post, I am loving it.

### Step 3. Setup boot drive

Setting up a boot drive is a simple process. Rufus or Balena Etcher are 2 tools
I use. There are tons of guides on how to do this exact thing
(for example, [this one from Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows)).
I might write a post on how to do this sometime in the future.
But for now, just Google it. ;)

### Step 4. Do the damn thing

Procrastination can be a weak point of mine. There is no more preparing I can do
at this point in the process.

> The fear from pressing format on my Windows partition and
> installing Linux was terrifying to say the least.

## Current Reflection

I've been daily driving Linux Mint for a few weeks now. I had to make sacrifices
some of them being difficult. But I definitely have been more productive.
Look, I've even set up a blog.. who saw that coming??

## Should You Daily Drive Linux?

This really just depends on what your goals are. Generally, I would say yes.

### You should absolutely daily drive Linux if you

- are newer to tech
- don't know how to use Linux
- have or want a career that will require Linux knowledge

### Maybe daily drive Linux if you

- are curious
- want something new
- need productivity accountability

### You should _not_ daily drive Linux if you

- hate computers
- hate figuring anything out
- have to play every single game
