## Why Did I Switch?

After a long day of work I would find myself playing video games to relax.
While there's nothing wrong with playing video games,
I would frequently look back and miss the curiousity I had.

I used to be able to talk so in-depth about a new project, or
something newly exciting I've learned. I could but it was always regarding
work projects. Rarely had it become anything I was doing outside of work.

Finally, I decided that it was time to make it easier to do tech shenanigans
than play my lil video games. Thus I installed Linux.

## My Process

This whole process was terrifying really. I have spent forever on Windows.
Yes I have spun up Linux VMs and I have Linux running on servers..
but I haven't had to do without Microsoft's opinion on everything.

I was eager to come up with a plan to make this switch easier.
However, with planning being an arch enemy to doing, I had to be willing to make
some sacrifies.

I came up with an actionable plan.

BLOG_TODO: I'm planning on coming back to this and fleshing it out more.
There's a little more to this sto

### 1. Back up my data

### 2. Pick a <mark>stable</mark> distro

### 3. Setup boot drive

### 4. Do the damn thing
