title: "Is AI Hurting You?"

Everyone is different. But the idea is the same: If you do less of a thing, you get worse at it. If you're wanting to build skills, use AI minimally. If you're wanting to have outputs, use AI maximally. And there's not really an in-between in my mind. Using AI some of the time, turns into more. I use AI for things when I'm needing outputs and I use it in a capacity like, "beat this idea into my head in different ways until I understand it". But if I'm working with a technology that I'm wanting/needing to learn, I try hard to rarely use AI.

Even though you get similar (sometimes better) results when Googling, you go through a lot less mental cycles with AI. Scraping through forums, rewording your query, trying random shit, getting mad, is all part of the reinforcement phase of the learning cycle.

But this is all merely from my experience and assumptions. I'm no psychologist or even an expert in any field for that matter.

Super rough draft notes:

- To truly learn something it is a very iterative process.
- We learn by failures. Failing confirms routes that do not work.
- After failing repeatedly, and finally reaching the solution, the good feelings help reinforce what you did was right.
- Because AI isn't perfect, AI doesn't always remove the iterations, but it removes the need to understand
  why/what the iteration was.
- To use AI to _assist_ your learning, you could do a few things:
  - Prompt to rephrase lesson sections
  - Nudge you in the right direction without explicitly giving you the answer
  - Get the AI to quiz you for ensuring you understand the material

## Introduction

AI is everywhere. Integrated into your everyday apps, your phone,
and advertisements selling AI services constantly being shoved in your face.
The presence and promises of AI offer a lot of value add, but surely a
downfall exists...

Statistically, you have used AI [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/06/03/mind-blowing-ai-statistics-everyone-must-know-about-now-in-2025/).
We both know that AI can make many tasks easier. Tasks being easier is perfect
for work output and productivity, but is really harmful to learning and skill building.

I have even noticed having less of a true understanding during my studies after
improper use of AI.

## How Learning Really Works

What does "learn" even mean? [Merriam Webster defines learn](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/learn) as:

> to gain knowledge or understanding of or skill in by study, instruction, or experience

Notice that even the definition associates learning with study and experience.
Truly learning something requires an understanding. You cannot have learned something
that you do not understand.

Iteration is the best method to reach an understanding. Iterating over
and over again is a loop that looks like this:

<div>
  <pre class="mermaid">

flowchart TB
    A["Make an Attempt"] --> B{"Fail?"}
    B -- Yes --> C["Understand the Failure; This is where you learn"]
    C -- Try again with new insight --> A
    B -- No --> D["Viable Solution"]
  </pre>
  <script type="module">
    import mermaid from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs";
  </script>
</div>

In the flowchart, you can see that learning occurs by understanding your failure.
Failure and frustration shows us a very clear picture of what went wrong (if you
dig deeper to understand). Thus building a stronger foundation for the skill.

## How AI Can Hurt Your Learning

- TODO: Maybe a little intro here

### Skipping the Struggling: Why Easy Answers Don't Stick

As I previously mentioned, struggling/failing is the part of the process that
you learn the most from. While you will still certainly struggle with AI,
the failures are different.

AI removes the need for you to understand everything with your attempt.
When you have the failure, you can simply get the AI to try again without
you ever having to think through _why_ the failure happened.

These sort of solutions often leave a very shallow mental footprint. This shallow
footprint makes it less ideal for building applicable skills. "Easy come, easy go".

### Less Reinforcement, Less Retention

Going through the iterations of trial and error builds a strong muscle
memory. Not to get all "inception-y" but learning can get.

- Trial and error builds "muscle memory" for thinking
- AI reduces how many cycles you go through
- Fewer cycles = less reinforcement = weaker long-term recall

### The False Sense of Mastery

While skill building, going quickly from problem to solution from AI's help
feels like progress but doesn't ensure you are building a good understanding.

Would you know how to bake a cake from someone baking it for you? In this
scenario, you would completely know the solution but it does not help you

Sometimes understanding a solution can help you understand the process to get
there

- You may know the solution but not the "why"
- Confidence vs competence

## How to Use AI for Learning Without Skill Atrophy

- Rough notes for this section:
  - In gymnastics, many coaches implement something called "spotting". Spotting is
    a process where the coach will guide the individual through doing the flips or
    routine. This process helps with safety, correcting faults, and building muscle
    memory for the athlete without having to fully grasp the concept alone.

### Rephrase Complex Concepts for Clarity

- Use AI to explaing a tough topic in multiple ways
- Comare its explanation with your notes to check alignment
- Don't stop at the AI output. Treat it as one extra perspective
- Insert good prompt to do this

### Ask for Hints Instead of Full Answers

- Frame prompts like: "Point me in the right direction"
- Keep ownership of solving, just use AI as a nudge
- Insert good prompt to do this

### Use AI to Quiz and Test Yourself

- Ask it to geenrate practice questions or flashcards
  - Test your recall without looking back at notes
- Turn AI into a "sparring partner" instead of a crutch

## When It's Better to Use AI for Productivity

- When the goal is an output, not skill-building
- Useful for repetitive or low-value tasks where learning isn't the priority

## Conclusion: Finding the Right Balance

- AI is a tool, not a replacement for the learning process
- Use it when the goal is speed and output, not when you need to master something
- Struggle and failure aren't inefficiencies, they're how we build lasting skills
- Treat AI like a guide, not a crutch
- Balance = knowing when to lean on it and when to step back
